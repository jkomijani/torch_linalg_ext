    Return eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 3x3 normal matrices.
    
    A matrix is normal if and only if there exists a diagonal matrix of
    eigenvalues a unitary matrix of eigenvectors, meaning the eigenvectors can
    be orthogonalized.
    (In this function, one of the eigenvectors is constructed simply assuming
    the eigenvectors are orthonormal, which holds for normal matrices.)
    Example of normal matrices are Hermitian and unitary matrices.

    The eigenvalues are obtained by calling `eigvals3x3`, which uses a closed
    form expression.

    To calculate the eigenvectors, one can exploit vector cross products in 3
    dimensions as described in [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0610206]
    "Efficient numerical diagonalization of hermitian 3x3 matrices".
    (The method works for any normal matrices and with some modification can
    be used for any 3x3 matrices.)
    This method is pretty fast, but the error can be relatively large when the
    cross product is close to zero.
    We developed an alternative version that is about 30% slower but in general
    more accurate. For the former one, set `method='cross-product'` and for the
    latter one use `method='direct'`. The default is the latter one.

    Here are a few remarks about both methods:

    1.  Both methods are senstive to round-off errors when the condition number
        is large or when the eigenvalues are very close to each other.
        As a remedy, we consider following cases:

    2a. When there are (almost) two degenerate eigenvectors, one eigenvector
        can be constructed by cross product of the other two as suggested in
        the above paper. (This property holds for normal matrices.)
        Therefore, with sorted eigenvalues, we always construct the middle
        eigenvector by the cross product of the first and last eigenvectors.

    2b. When there are almost three degenerate eigenvectors, the matrix is
        close to a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues might not be very precise
        (because the cancelations in the exact formula amplify the round-off
        effects) and the matrix of eigenvectors might not be precise either.
        To handle the problem, we first convert the matrix to a traceless
        matrix.

    1. We transform the matrix so that the first and second columns become

    2. The first and second columns of the transformed matrix must be parallel,
    unless the third column is zero. The null space of the transformed matrix
    is a column matrix as :math:`(t; s; 0)` if the third column is not zero,

    A remark on precision: if the third column is not identically zero, but
    very small, the above method may fail from round-off errors. To avoid the
    problem, we can switch to another method that uses cross-product of the
